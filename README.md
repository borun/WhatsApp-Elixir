# WhatsApp-Elixir

## What
This project is basically focused on viewing and searching the WhatsApp backup taken by **iTunes** in a desktop environment. The project and its idea is not mine at all, I just made this project usable to me and giving it back to the community in case anyone find it more useful than the original one.

## Why
I think we all know why this project is necessary! Applications like WhatsApp and Viber DO NOT provide any mechanism (at the time of this writing) to transfer data/history when someone change their OS (from iOS to Android or vice versa). Besides, I couldn't find any trustworthy third party to transfer this for me. So I just kept my iTunes backup in my desktop. Tune this App so that I can view my whatsapp messages, images and search them. Then I shifted to Android again!

## Major Changes
* It was basically for both Android and iOS. I made it only for iOS.
* I have included images in message viewer
* Search has been improved a lot
* Everything is loading in memory for faster processing
* A installer project added
